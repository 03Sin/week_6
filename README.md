## Welcome to Week 6. 
## In this cloned repo are three folders::
## 1: week_6_day_one_practice
## 2: week_6_day_two_practice
## 1: week_6_day_three_practice
## Each day comes with a set of practice problems that should help in scaffolding 
### you to complete this week's deliverable. 
## Each day also comes with a set of challenge questions that are just good additional practice points 
## Feel free to work on those as well especially if you finish early. 
## This weeks deliverable is all about putting together a gif finding API. 
## Feel free to check it out the vid on Google Classroom if you have not already done so. 
## Now open up your week_6_day_one_practice folder and begin with reading the README in there.
