## Welcome to Week 6 Day One Practice Folder
## This is all about JSON
## JSON is an ancronym that stands for Javascript Object Notation and is the statndard for data formatting 
## when it comes to RESTful API's (REpresentational State Transfer Application Program Interface)
## That's a lot to deconstruct but all it is, is a method for packing data (in JSON) from one server or servers to a website or application
## You've seen API's all over the place and never knew. Here's a brief list:
## 1 - Relit Sign Up (https://repl.it/signup): On this page you'll see three icons (Google, Github, and Facebook). 
## If you were logged in to either one of those accounts and then clicked on one of those icons. You'd be able to sign up for Replit without typing in any information. 
## 2 - Google Maps : there are multiple sites that have embedded Google maps on them to show you the location of either their restaurant, store, etc.
## 3 - Kayak : Going on a trip? Well if you are looking at flights request to look at prices. You'll be given a list of airline details from multiple different airlines including seat avaialble, prices and departure times.
## Anyway let's get to practicing. 
## Now open up your example.json file to begin your coding.
