## Welcome to Week 6 Deliverable: Fetch API Template
## You'll be building Giphy web Application using the Giphy API. 
## Many of the things here are new so don't panic.
## After reading the rest of this readme follow all the comments listed in script.js

# Fetch API Template

The goal is to code out a gif-finder that takes in a user's keyword and sends you back the gifs that meet that criteria.

## Live Preview; 
    Open your index.html file and click on Preview. Then click on Live Preview file to see your code output.
    
## Warm up!

The page has a button on it already. Code out an event listener in the script.js file that logs "button pressed!" to the console when the button is pressed, and confirm that it is working.

## Get an API key

1. Go to [https://developers.giphy.com/](https://developers.giphy.com/).
2. Log in or create a developer account.
3. Click "create an app". Give it whatever name ("test") and description ("testing the API") you like.
4. Copy your API key and get ready to code
5. If you think you know what comes next, open up script.js and code out what's missing.
